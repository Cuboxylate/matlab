# Random Walks Visualisation Assignment
A set of MATLAB functions written for a university assignment.

Written in conjunction with my partner, <a href="http://github.com/denbeigh2000">denbeigh2000</a>

<<<<<<< HEAD
The assignment specifications are included, but the basic breakdown is as
follows:

##### question1a.m
Modelling and visualising the random walk of a single ant in 100x100 grid.

##### question1b.m
Modelling and visualising random walk of k ants
    in a grid.

##### question1c.m
Perfoming n trials of k ants doing a random walk, and visualising the
    frequency of end positions

##### question1d.m
Modelling and visualising an agglomeration - at each time step a random
    coordinate adjacent to the agglomerate is added to the agglomerate.

Each of these programs has associated images of the visualisation
created.

##### question2a.m
Find the what fraction of coordinates contain the minimum value in a large
    matrix, representing sea level in a map.
##### question2b.m
Find what fraction of the map is underwater after a change in sea level.

##### question2c.m
Find the probability of a random walk starting in the centre of the map,
    finding the ocean within a set time period.
